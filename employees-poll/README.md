# Employee Polls Project - a react and redux base application

This application is essentially based off of following different components 
 - Login Page
    - which is having a dropdown to select a user.
 - Nav Bar
    - User can navigate between different components i.e. Home, LeaderBoard, Ask?
 - UnAnswered Questions(sorted Latest on the top)
    - Which basically shows the questions which have not been answered by the logged In user.
 - Answered Questions(sorted Latest on the top)
    - Similar to UnAnswered Questions this component renders the questions answered by Logged In user.
 -LeaderBoard
    - Shows the detail overview of all the users.
 - Ask?
    - will let the user ask a new question.

## Lessons Learned

While building this project I learned:

- Why is react better and faster way of developing web applications.
- How to use State Management in the different components.
- How can I utilize Redux Management to further improve my development.
- About three most important concepts regarding redux.
    - Actions
    - Reducers
    - Middleware
- That redux makes it easier to pass the data to any component of the application.

Challanges I faced:

The biggest Challange was the logic to separate the answered and unanswered questions.
